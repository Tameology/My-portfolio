    <h1>Who I Am</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Christofer Morales-Nunez, and Im currently a rising senior at Guadalupe Centers High School. Im deeply passionate about electrical engineering, coding, motorsport racing, and 3D printing. My curiosity and drive to innovate have led me to work on personal engineering projects, including converting an RC car from radio wave control to Bluetooth connectivity. Ive also designed and 3D printed custom parts to accommodate the new components, combining my love for hands-on building with creative problem-solving. Whether Im writing code, designing circuits, or watching the latest motorsport race, Im always looking for ways to push boundaries and bring ideas to life.</p>
