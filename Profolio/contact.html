    <h1>Where I Plan to Go to College</h1>
    <p>As of right now, I still in High School, but I will become a Senior once school begins again. So I need to consider where I plan to go. Most likely than not I will be in the Engineering field, and more specificly, in Electrical. I would like to get into a prestigous school, like MIT university. But if not, then something more local, like Mizzou, which has Formal FAE, which is a program that puts you in a team that builds a kart for racing. It has both fully eletric, and fully gased powered karts, with there own respective teams.</p>
